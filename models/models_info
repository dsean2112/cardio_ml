Models:

spectrogram_models:  
spectro_i, spectro_ii, spectro_v6: trained on unfiltered spectrogram data
spectro_bilstm_i: trained on unfiltered spectrogram data, with bidirectional LSTM layers

standard_models: trained on unfiltered signal (1 dimensional) data

bandpasss_data_models: trained on filtered signal (1 dimensional) (not as specific/sensitive)

old models: ignore
